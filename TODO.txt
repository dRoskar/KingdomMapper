## BUGS ##
[X] points aren't showing
[X] wfs layers aren't showing data
[X] switch maps around a bit, load an empty map, create a layer, add a polynom, makes 3 polynoms. I think the drawing vector might be getting stacked
[X] database special characters (naming a layer "santa's house" kills the app)
[X] when drawing a polygon, user can hold shift and click, making a polygon with only one point, which is invalid (probably also fails for lines)
[ ] maps with special characters show up encoded in the existing map picker
[X] layer tree sort uncheks and unselects layers (I think the selected layer is still selected, just not visually)
[X] deleting the last layer in the tree causes an error
