[X] disable drawing toolbar
[X] switch between layers when editing mode is on
[X] editing and drawing happens on seperate vector layers
[X] redraw when features are added
[X] adding new maps
[X] adding new layers
[X] if deleting layer, delete all its items first; same if deleting maps; same if deleting users
[X] deleting layers / maps makes things not break
[X] layer tree checking controls visibility
[X] Markers and points are different things
	
[X] layer tree position correlates to z axis
	[X] Bring to front
	[X] Send to back
	[X] Refresh layer tree sort at z index change
	[X] z index handling when adding new layers
	
[X] update layer data (visibility, Z axis) at key events (on window close, on new map loaded/added
[X] update user data (last map open) at key events
[X] cancel drawing with escape (http://demo.gwt-openlayers.org/gwt_ol_showcase/GwtOpenLayersShowcase.html?example=Cancel%20drawing)

[.] vector editing
	[X] moving features
	[X] inserting and moving vertices
	[.] buttons display depending on type of layer selected
	[X] deleting features
	[ ] adding description
	[ ] changing styles
	
[X] Remember what map user was editing last

[X] editing and layer visibility
	[X] if layer is not visible you can't edit it (disable edit menu)
	[X] layer can't be made invisible while editing; scratch that - disable editing mode if layer is made invisible while editing
	[X] if layer is switched to invisible layer while edit mode is on, keep the button pressed, so a visible layer can be selected next and edited, but don't allow the current (invisible) layer to be edited; disable edit menu

[X] if you're editing and switch to a different layer that doesn't have that function, dont't allow editing that layer but keep the mode on

## BUGS ##
[X] points aren't showing
[X] wfs layers aren't showing data
[X] switch maps around a bit, load an empty map, create a layer, add a polynom, makes 3 polynoms. I think the drawing vector might be getting stacked
[X] database special characters (naming a layer "santa's house" kills the app)
[X] when drawing a polygon, user can hold shift and click, making a polygon with only one point, which is invalid (probably also fails for lines)
[ ] maps with special characters show up encoded in the existing map picker
[X] layer tree sort uncheks and unselects layers (I think the selected layer is still selected, just not visually)
[X] deleting the last layer in the tree causes an error
[ ] select layer, turn edit mode on and off, and send layer to top. grid is top again (probably gets assigned a huge z index somewhere in between, maybe if setting it to 0 everytime you resort will fix this)
[ ] select layer, toggle vertice-moving, drag a vertex, click move to front, switch off edit mode, layer is not in front
[ ] layer with multiple features, select erase tool, click on a feature, it's gone. Click on empty space, feature is back (only on wfs layer)
