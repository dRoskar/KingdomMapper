[X] editing and layer visibility
	[X] if layer is not visible you can't edit it (disable edit menu)
	[X] layer can't be made invisible while editing; scratch that - disable editing mode if layer is made invisible while editing
	[X] if layer is switched to invisible layer while edit mode is on, keep the button pressed, so a visible layer can be selected next and edited, but don't allow the current (invisible) layer to be edited; disable edit menu

[X] if you're editing and switch to a different layer that doesn't have that function, dont't allow editing that layer but keep the mode on

[ ] if you have rotating (or moving vertices or scaling) on and switch to points, you don't have to do any mumo jumbo. Open layers already switches to drag on it's own, and back to desired control when going back to lines/polygons

## LONG-TERM ##
[ ] all kinds of shapes on the same layer?
[ ] drawing straight lines
[ ] drawing line rectangles
[ ] drawing line circles
[ ] select (and edit) multiple features
[ ] subtract shapes from lines and points
[ ] add different grid size choices
[ ] marker label fonts
[ ] print
[ ] dash line style
[ ] line corner and ends styles
[ ] layer tree folders
[ ] style editor preview (wms service)
[ ] upoadable markers https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/
[ ] uploadable textures
[ ] duplicate layer
[ ] vector sizes in ground units http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/sld-extensions/uom.html
[ ] example: if a wfs feature is selected while rotating, switch to scaling and feature does not get unselected
[ ] multiple styles for single layer could be achieved like so http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/sld-cookbook/lines.html#attribute-based-line
	for instance, each layer is allowed 10 styles, user determines properties for each style. Attributes are pre-named (style_1, style_2, ...)

## BUGS ##
[X] points aren't showing
[X] wfs layers aren't showing data
[X] switch maps around a bit, load an empty map, create a layer, add a polynom, makes 3 polynoms. I think the drawing vector might be getting stacked
[X] database special characters (naming a layer "santa's house" kills the app)
[X] when drawing a polygon, user can hold shift and click, making a polygon with only one point, which is invalid (probably also fails for lines)
[ ] maps with special characters show up encoded in the existing map picker
[X] layer tree sort uncheks and unselects layers (I think the selected layer is still selected, just not visually)
[X] deleting the last layer in the tree causes an error
[ ] select layer, turn edit mode on and off, and send layer to top. grid is top again (probably gets assigned a huge z index somewhere in between, maybe if setting it to 0 everytime you resort will fix this)
[ ] select layer, toggle vertice-moving, drag a vertex, click move to front, switch off edit mode, layer is not in front
[X] layer with multiple features, select erase tool, click on a feature, it's gone. Click on empty space, feature is back (only on wfs layer)
[X] click cancel when selecting color
[ ] subtract sometimes changes into add
[ ] if subtract is on when adding new layer, subtract stay on, but button is off (what about when adding new map?)
[ ] deleting a layer scramles z indices
