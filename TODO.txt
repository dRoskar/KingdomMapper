[X] Remember what map user was editing last

[X] editing and layer visibility
	[X] if layer is not visible you can't edit it (disable edit menu)
	[X] layer can't be made invisible while editing; scratch that - disable editing mode if layer is made invisible while editing
	[X] if layer is switched to invisible layer while edit mode is on, keep the button pressed, so a visible layer can be selected next and edited, but don't allow the current (invisible) layer to be edited; disable edit menu

[X] if you're editing and switch to a different layer that doesn't have that function, dont't allow editing that layer but keep the mode on

## BUGS ##
[X] points aren't showing
[X] wfs layers aren't showing data
[X] switch maps around a bit, load an empty map, create a layer, add a polynom, makes 3 polynoms. I think the drawing vector might be getting stacked
[X] database special characters (naming a layer "santa's house" kills the app)
[X] when drawing a polygon, user can hold shift and click, making a polygon with only one point, which is invalid (probably also fails for lines)
[ ] maps with special characters show up encoded in the existing map picker
[X] layer tree sort uncheks and unselects layers (I think the selected layer is still selected, just not visually)
[X] deleting the last layer in the tree causes an error
[ ] select layer, turn edit mode on and off, and send layer to top. grid is top again (probably gets assigned a huge z index somewhere in between, maybe if setting it to 0 everytime you resort will fix this)
[ ] select layer, toggle vertice-moving, drag a vertex, click move to front, switch off edit mode, layer is not in front
[X] layer with multiple features, select erase tool, click on a feature, it's gone. Click on empty space, feature is back (only on wfs layer)
[X] click cancel when selecting color
